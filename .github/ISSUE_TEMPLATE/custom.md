### Has your desired language [already been requested][lang-support]?
If your desired language has already been requested, it is preferable for you to +1 that issue.


### Which language would you like to add support for?
_i.e. `Java`, `Ruby`, `Lisp`_


### Which specific version?
_i.e. `Java17`, `Ruby 1.8.7`, `Common Lisp`_


### Can you provide a sample of TCP socket-based communication in this language?
_you can submit a working code sample, or links to documentation: either of which should demonstrate sending basic numeric and string types between two ends of a TCP socket_


### Are you available to help test the result?
_your requested language is more likely to be prioritized if we can identify people who are willing to test the solution_


## Are you willing to help maintain the solution, or know someone who is?
_while support for multiple languages is a goal of nmspec, there are only so many hours in the day - help is very much appreciated_
